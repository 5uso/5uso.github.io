                            <p>In 2020, I implemented an accurate emulation of the MOS 6502 microprocessor entirely in GLSL. Combined with my own implementation of the NES' Pixel Processing Unit (a predecessor to modern GPUs), I emulated the console's titles in real time fully on GPU. Tackling this complex task in an unusual way put my graphics knowledge to the test.</p>
                            <p>For this project, I hijacked a standard OpenGL graphics pipeline to perform general computation without compute shaders being available. I also accurately recreated the console's rendering capabilities.</p>
                            <p>Some time later, I came back to the project looking to optimize it to meet a 60fps performance target. By moving most of the computational load to the vertex shader, I was able to perform data transfers with optimized packed structures that removed most of the redundant processing across fragments. This improved performance massively, allowing for full-speed emulation.</p>

                            <p>Working for a project within Minecraft, I ran into limitations caused by its rendering engine. To achieve the results that I wanted, I resorted to dynamic code injections via Mixins. This way, I could implement new features on top of the already existing renderer, which is written in Java using OpenGL.</p>
                            <p>First of all, I created a context manager utility for loading shaders and handling exceptions that arose in the process. This was very useful as a development tool as it allowed me to more comfortably iterate integrating shaders.</p>
                            <p>I also gave myself the ability to inject arbitrary data-driven uniforms into both core and postprocessing shaders. In the game's engine, these two systems are separate and, while they share a lot of code, expose quite a few inconsistencies. I smoothed over some of these inconveniences with my implementation.</p>
                            <p>Another problem I found with the vanilla renderer is that the depth buffer often was overwritten by inconsequential render passes and could not be used appropriately during postprocessing. To fix the issue, I rearranged the way framebuffers are bound during rendering.</p>
                            <p>For this usecase, a lot of the game logic would be happening server side on my custom backend. Many resources such as shaders would be streamed to the clients dynamically. For this reason, it was desirable to be able to control the renderer from the serverside, which would also minimize the amount of updates we would have to push to the client during development. As such, I implemented some networking to be able to control aspects of the rendering remotely.</p>
                            <p>With my extended version of the engine, I was able to implement many effects that would have been impossible otherwise. The clips below showcase remotely data driven animations, uses of the improved custom posprocessing, as well as many added renderers (used, for instance, for HUDs).</p>

                            <p>While I consider my 3D work more interesting, I also have experience working with 2D rendering.</p>
                            <p>For this project I was required to build a 2D game engine from scratch using PyGame, an SDL/OpenGL wrapper for Python. Due to the overhead caused by the choice of language, optimizations were crucial to achieve real-time execution.</p>
                            <p>Our game required scenes to be built dynamically from many small tiles during runtime. This seemed problematic given the cost of managing PyGame sprite objects. To address the performance concerns, I came up with two key optimizations:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Managed terrain data in continuous buffers, using draw calls during a generation step to fill the buffer and then a single call per frame to handle all of the terrain at once.</li>
                                    <li>Provided a new implementation for PyGame's sprite groups capable of handling scrolling via transformations without the need to iterate through sprites.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>

                            <p>My bachelor's thesis consisted on designing and implementing a parallel algorithm for multi-view data clustering within High Performance Computing environments making use of graph theory.</p>
                            <p>I chose to implement the algorithm in C, as was fitting for low-level high-throughput data management. I made use of numerous optimization techniques, focusing on multithreading and multiprocessing. For this, I made use of OpenMP and MPI.</p>
                            <p>The resulting algorithm ran over 3600 times faster than the state of the art in a modestly-sized cluster. This work earned me a special distiction, a perfect score, and the award to the best thesis of my faculty.</p>

                            <p>For a few years, I took up competitive programming as a way to improve my problem solving, algorithmics, and teamwork. C++ was my language of choice during the competitions, which has allowed me to become acquainted with language features and improve my general proficiency.</p>
                            <p>During this time, I became the top performer at a regional level in Galicia, with my team winning the inter-university regional competition two years in a row. We were invited to the Spanish nationals, where we also performed among the top teams in the country.</p>
                            <p>The code produced during these events is rushed and unfit for professional projects, but it still serves as good practice for highly performant algorithms: <a href="https://github.com/5uso/Competitive-Samples">Code samples on GitHub</a></p>

                            <p>I love tinkering with game internals, and as a result have worked on mods for quite a few titles. A few years back I got interested in performing code edits on the Nintendo Switch release of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. While modding for the Wii U release was relatively well understood at the time, loading code on the switch version — and on real hardware — proved more difficult.</p>
                            <p>At this point, the community had partially ported over a set of development tools that were originally designed for Super Smash Brothers Ultimate. However, the key component I needed, running custom code on hooks via plugins, was missing. As such, I decided to reimplement it myself taking the Smash version as a reference.</p>

                            <p>At the start of 2021, our development team noticed the URLs where user-uploaded images were located in Mojang's servers corresponded to their SHA256 hashes. By controlling these hashes, it should be possible to transmit arbitrary data to clients consuming the API. This would allow webservers to communicate with applications written to run within Minecraft, something that was thought to be completely impossible.</p>
                            <p>We started work on developing the fastest way to compute all the hashes we would need. At first, the estimated runtime was over 2 years. However, after numerous optimizations, we were able to generate an extremely compressed database weighing in at 8GB, with the information corresponding to 235 individual images in a couple of hours, which allowed us to reliably transmit 32 bits of information per hash. Once the computation was complete, subsequent queries to this database were instantaneous, allowing us to use them in a game service.</p>

                            <p>During my time working at Sngular, I was part of a project focusing on automated code generation based on web API definitions (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI). I was tasked with extending generation to be able to handle nested type definitions. Due to the existing typing system lacking versatility, I decided to reimplement it from the ground up with support for recursion. My solution handled the complex data structures we were targeting, and preserved all of the functionality stakeholders relied upon, as verified by out TDD methodology.</p>

                            <p>In August 2022, I was put in charge of directing a project with the aim of producing an action RPG experience between 50 creators within a one week time limit. One of the challenges we faced is we wanted to provide players with loot items distributed across the map, and needed a standard way to generate and balance them, with members of the project being able to push updates on the fly.</p>
                            <p>My solution was throwing together a tool we could self-host on GCP. In it, contributors could manage loot data and distribution, seeing the changes other users made in real time. It featured an easy to use interface, tracked changes, and serialized data into a machine-readable format so that it could be automatically integrated ingame. This allowed us to coordinate smoothly during the fast development process, producing cohesive and balanced loot across the game even with a large team making simultaneous changes.</p>

                            <p>The project had been stalled for years, and I was brought on board in order to finally get it back on track. We achieved this goal within a few months of work, hitting our target release date window. I also coordinated the release process and handled post-launch updates. In the end, the map received glowing reviews, going on to become one of the best valued by the community, and has been played over 40,000 times.</p>
